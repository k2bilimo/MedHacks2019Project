# MedHacks 2019 - Dementia VR

This project was created at MedHacks 2019. 

Project Overview:
* A virtual reality application that tests the user's spatial awareness
* Spatial awareness is one of the first areas of weakness for a person that is likely to be diagnosed with Alhzeimer's Disease in the future. Alzheimer's is one of the leading causes of Dementia. 

# Inspiration
* By 2050, 131M people in the world will have Dementia, which is a staggering number
* Dementia is often diagnosed after it has already progressed significantly, leaving little room or hope for improvement in patients

There are two main causes for this:
* Intervention trials to slow the progression of Dementia have failed due to problems in identifying the initial stages of Alzheimer's 
* Accessibility: many people ignore early symptoms and put off visiting a doctor for financial reasons, busy work schedules, etc., which causes the disease to progress untreated


Recent research by Professor John O'Keefe of UCL (for which he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology) showed that a region of the brain called the Entorhinal Cortex contains an ability for the brain to be aware of its surroundings.

This area of the brain is also the very first region that is damaged in Alzheimer's disease. However, the traditional pen-and-paper cognitive tests used at the clinic to diagnose the condition are unable to test for navigation difficulties. 

Therefore, our team created a virtual reality spatial recognition test in which the user walks around a grassy field with different monuments and artifacts. 

The user is forced to go back to their original location through the same path with which they came. This tests both spatial recognition and memory. 

## Technical Details
The team used Unity 3D to program the environment, Google Sketchup for the 3D models, and Google Cardboard to implement virtual reality.

# Final Thoughts
* Dementia will affect a large amount of the global population by 2050, and it is a priority for several World Organizations
* Traditional tests to diagnose Alzheimer's (a leading cause of Dementia) should be updated using new technology (virtual reality) to diagnose patients earlier and start the treatment
